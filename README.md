# my-website
A personalized web page created by me that includes all the links to my social, threads, code, or other forums. A blog themed website that contains details about myself and stories that I have written in Medium. The about section includes information about myself along with my snapchat lenses, films that I like that is technology related and a resume. 

# Tech used: ![ReactBadge](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
My learning was focused on making a simple UI that resembled a blog style them with a smooth UX bundled with articles that I have written myself. 

# Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would start adding a dark mode theme and a different language options. I would like to implement some api's that root to my articles on Medium.

# Lessons Learned:

<ul>
 <li>Implementing the site in React</li>
 <li>Implementing a filter with a dropdown list for my lenses and understanding the onchange feature.</li>
</ul>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
